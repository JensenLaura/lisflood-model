## About this model documentation

This Github repository contains the most up-to-date and complete technical documentation of the LISFLOOD model. 
This includes the concepts and model equations of all the standard LISFLOOD processes, and all the optional modules.

The objective of this model documentation is to provide the interested user with a transparent picture of the hydrological model in order to understand what's behind it.

This document is **not a LISFLOOD user guide!** 

A LISFLOOD user guide can be found at the dedicated [Github Pages](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/) from lisflood-code repository. 
It is a step-by-step guide on what you need to do and know throughout the whole processing chain, from defining the system requirements to generating the LISFLOOD output. 


### Use cases / Test Basins

We have created two use cases to help you to set up and test the model on your PC. One use case is located in [Italy (Po basin)](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases/blob/master/README.md#usecase2) and the other is located in [Canada (Fraser basin)](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases/blob/master/README.md#usecase1). 

For details and instructions on how to execute the tests, please visit the [LISFLOOD usecases repository](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases). 

Once you are able to execute the simulation for those use cases, you can confirm that the LISFLOOD model has been installed and configured correctly on your PC.

In order to help you prepare the set-up of your own catchment we have created another Github repository [lisflood-utilities](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-utilities). This repository contains all the tools required to set-up and run LISFLOOD for your own basin. An explanation on how to use each tool is also provided.

Lastly, we also share two other tools: 

1. [LISVAP](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-lisvap/), for the calculation of the potential evapotranspiration which is a required input parameter for LISFLOOD and 
2. a [calibration tool](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-calibration/) allows to calibrate the catchments which were set up with LISFLOOD using observed discharge data.
