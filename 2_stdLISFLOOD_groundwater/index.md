## Groundwater

Groundwater storage and transport are modelled using two parallel linear reservoirs, similar to the approach used in the HBV-96 model (Lindstr√∂m et al., 1997). The upper zone represents a quick runoff component, which includes fast groundwater and subsurface flow through macro-pores in the soil. The lower zone represents the slow groundwater component that generates the base flow. The **outflow from the upper zone to the channel**, $Q_{uz} [mm]$ equals:

$$
Q_{uz} = \frac{1}{T_{uz}} \cdot UZ \cdot \Delta t
$$

where $T_{uz}$ is a reservoir constant $[days]$ and $UZ$ is the amount of water that is stored in the upper zone $[mm]$. Similarly, the **outflow from the lower zone** is given by:

$$
Q_{lz} = \frac{1}{T_{lz}} \cdot LZ \cdot \Delta t
$$

Here, $T_{lz}$ is again a reservoir constant $[days]$, and $LZ$ is the amount of water that is stored in the lower zone $[mm]$. The values of both $T_{uz}$ and $T_{lz}$ are obtained by calibration. The upper zone also provides the inflow into the lower zone. For each time step, a fixed amount of **water percolates from the upper to the lower zone**:

$$
D_{uz,lz} = min (GW_{perc} \cdot \Delta t ,UZ)
$$

Here, $GW_{perc} \ [\frac{mm}{day}]$ is a user-defined value that is determined during calibration. 
Note that these equations are again valid for the permeable fraction of the pixel only: storage in the direct runoff fraction equals 0 for both $UZ$ and $LZ$.
