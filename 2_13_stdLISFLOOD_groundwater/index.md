## Groundwater

Groundwater storage and transport are modelled using two parallel linear reservoirs, similar to the approach used in the HBV-96 model (Lindstr√∂m et al., 1997). The upper zone represents a quick runoff component, which includes fast groundwater and subsurface flow through macro-pores in the soil. The lower zone represents the slow groundwater component that generates the base flow. The **outflow from the upper zone to the channel**, $Q_{uz} [mm]$ equals:

$$
Q_{uz} = \frac{1}{T_{uz}} \cdot UZ \cdot \Delta t
$$

where $T_{uz}$ is the reservoir constant for the upper groundwater layer $[days]$ and $UZ$ is the amount of water that is stored in the upper zone $[mm]$. 

The amount of water stored in the upper zone $UZ$ is computed as follows:

$$
UZ = $D'{2,gw}$ + D_{pref,gw} - D_{uz,lz}
$$

where $D'{2,gw}$ is the flux from the lower soil layer to groundwater for this sub-step; $D_{pref,gw}$ is the amount of preferential flow per time step; D_{uz,lz} is the amount of **water that percolates from the upper to the lower zone**, all in $[mm]$.

In areas with drained irrigation ($DrainedFraction$), the flux from the lower soil layer to groundwater $D'{2,gw}$ is directly delivered to the river channel, consequenlty, the computation of $UZ$ is modifies as follows:

$$
UZ = (1 - DrainedFraction) \cdot $D'{2,gw}$ + D_{pref,gw} - D_{uz,lz}
$$

In areas with flooded irrigation (e.g. rice crops), an additional amount of water is added to $UZ$ during the percolation and draining phases of the agricultural cycle ($RicePercolationeWater$ and $RiceDrainageWater$ are described in a [dedicated chapter](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_17_stdLISFLOOD_irrigation/).

The **water percolates from the upper to the lower zone** ($D_{uz,lz}$) is the inflow to the lower groundwater zone. As indicated above, this amount of water is provided by the upper groundwater zone.  $D_{uz,lz}$ is a fixed amount per computational time step and it is defined as follows:

$$
D_{uz,lz} = min (GW_{perc} \cdot \Delta t ,UZ)
$$

Here, $GW_{perc} \ [\frac{mm}{day}]$ is the maximum percolation rate from the upper to the lower groundwater zone. going from the Upper to the Lower
                    
The **outflow from the lower zone to the channel** is then computed by:

$$
Q_{lz} = \frac{1}{T_{lz}} \cdot LZ \cdot \Delta t
$$

Here, $T_{lz}$ is the reservoir constant for the lower groundwater layer ($[days]$), and $LZ$ is the amount of water that is stored in the lower zone ($[mm]$). 

$LZ$ is computed as follows:

$$
LZ = D_{uz,lz}  - totGW_{abstr} - ( GW_{loss} \cdot \Delta t ) 
$$

where $D_{uz,lz}$ is the percolation from the upper groundwater zone ($[mm]$); $totGW_{abstr}$ is the total amount of [**water abstracted from groundwater**](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_18_stdLISFLOOD_water-use/) to comply with domestic,industrial, irrigation, and livestock demand ($[mm]$);$GW_{loss}$ is the maximum percolation rate from the lower groundwater zone ($[\frac{mm}{day}]$). 

The amount of water defined by $GW_{loss}$ never rejoins the river channel and it's lost beyond the catchment boundaries or to deep groundwater systems. $GW_{loss}$ is set to zero in catchments were no information is available. The larger the value of $GW_{loss}$, the larger the amount of water that leaves the system.

LISFLOOD hence abstracts groundwater from the Lower Zone (LZ). Groundwater depletion can thus be examined by monitoring the LZ levels between the start and the end of a simulation. Given the intra- and inter-annual fluctuations of LZ, it is advisable to monitor more on decadal periods.

If $LZ$ (lower groundwater amount) decreases below a groundwater threshold value ($LZThreshold$), the baseflow  Q_{lz} from the lower groundwater zone to the nearby rivers is zero. When sufficient recharge is added again to raise the $LZ$ levels above the threshold, baseflow will start again. This mimicks the behaviour of some river basins in very dry episodes, where aquifers temporarily lose their connection to major rivers and baseflow is reduced. $LZThreshold$ values are likely different for various (sub)river basins. 

The values of $T_{uz}$ ($[days]$), $T_{lz}$ ($[days]$), $GW_{perc}$ ($[\frac{mm}{day}]$), $GW_{loss}$ ($[\frac{mm}{day}]$), and $LZThreshold$ ($[mm]$) are obtained by calibration. 
To avoid spurious results (**and mass balance errors - BE SURE OF THIS**), when $GW_{perc}$<$GW_{loss}$, $GW_{perc}$ is set equal to $GW_{loss}$.

Note that these equations are valid for the permeable fraction of the pixel only: storage in the direct runoff fraction equals 0 for both $UZ$ and $LZ$.
