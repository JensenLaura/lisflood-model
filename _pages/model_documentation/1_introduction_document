## About this hydrological model documentation

This revised User Manual documents LISFLOOD version December 1 2013, and replaces all previous documentation of the model (e.g. van der Knijff & de Roo, 2008; de Roo *et. al.*, 2003). The scope of this document is to give model users all the information that is needed for successfully using LISFLOOD.
**Chapter XXXXX** explains the theory behind the model, including all model equations and the changes to the previous version. The remaining chapters cover all practical aspects of working with LISFLOOD. **Chapter xxxx to xxxx** explains how to setup LISFLOOD, how to modify the settings and the outputs.
A series of Annexes at the end of this document describe some optional features that can be activated  when running the model. Most model users will not need these features (which are disabled by default), and for the sake of clarity we therefore decided to keep their description out of the main text. The  current document does not cover the calculation of the potential evapo (transpi)ration rates that are  needed as input to the model. A separate pre-processor (LISVAP) exists that calculates these variables  from standard (gridded) meteorological observations. LISVAP is documented in a separate volume (van  der Knijff, 2006).
