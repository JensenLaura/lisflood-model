# Routing (horizonal flow processes)

## Routing of surface runoff to channel

Surface runoff is routed to the nearest downstream channel using a 4-point implicit finite-difference  solution of the kinematic wave equations (Chow, 1988). The basic equations used are the equations of
continuity and momentum. The continuity equation is:
$$
\frac{\partial {Q_{sr}}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial{A_{sr}}}{\partial t} = {q_{sr}}
$$
where $Q_{sr}$ is the surface runoff $[\frac{m^3}{ s}]$, $A_{sr}$  is the cross-sectional area of the flow $[m^2]$ and $q_{sr}$ is the amount of lateral inflow per unit flow length $[\frac{m^2}{s}]$. The momentum equation is defined as:
$$
\rho \cdot g \cdot A_{sr} \cdot (S_0 - S_f) = 0
$$
where $\rho$ is the density of the flow $[\frac{kg}{m^3}]$, $g$ is the gravity acceleration $[\frac{m}{s^2}]$, $S_0$ is the topographical gradient and $S_f$ is the friction gradient. From the momentum equation it follows that $S_0~= S_f$, which means that for the kinematic wave equations it is assumed that the water surface is parallel to the topographical surface. The continuity equation can also be written in the following finite-difference form (please note that for the sake of readability the 'sr' subscripts are omitted here from *Q*, *A* and *q*):
$$
\frac{Q_{i + 1}^{j + 1} - Q_i^{j + 1}}{\Delta x} +\frac{A_{i + 1}^{j + 1} - A_{i + 1}^j}{\Delta t} =\frac{q_{i + 1}^{j + 1} - q_{i + 1}^j}{2}
$$
where *j* is a time index and *i* a space index (such that *i=1* for the most upstream cell, *i=2* for its downstream neighbor, etcetera). The momentum equation can also be expressed as (Chow et al., 1988):
$$
A_{sr} = \alpha_ {k,sr} \cdot Q_{sr}^{\beta _k}
$$
Substituting the right-hand side of this expression in the finite-difference form of the continuity equation gives a nonlinear implicit finite-difference solution of the kinematic wave:
$$
\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\cdot Q_{i + 1}^{j + 1} \alpha _k \cdot (Q_{i + 1}^{j + 1})^{\beta _k} = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \cdot Q_i^{j + 1} \alpha _k \cdot (Q_{i + 1}^j)^{\beta_k}\Delta t \cdot (\frac{q_{i + 1}^{j + 1} + q_{i + 1}^j}{2})
$$
If $Œ±_{k,sr}$ and $Œ≤_k$ are known, this non-linear equation can be solved for each pixel and during each time step using an iterative procedure. This numerical solution scheme is available as a built-in function in the PCRaster software. The coefficients $Œ±_{k,sr}$ and $Œ≤_k$ are calculated by substituting Manning's equation in the right-hand side of Equation:
$$
A_{sr} = (\frac{n \cdot P_{sr}^{2/3}}{\sqrt{S_0}}) \cdot Q_{sr}^{3/5}
$$
where *n* is Manning's roughness coefficient and $P_{sr}$ is the wetted perimeter of a cross-section of the surface flow. Substituting the right-hand side of this equation for $A_{sr}$ in equation gives:
$$
\alpha _{k,sr} = (\frac{n \cdot P_{sr}^{2/3}}{\sqrt{S_0}})^{0.6} ; \beta_k=0.6
$$
At present, LISFLOOD uses values for $Œ±_{k,sr}$ which are based on a static (reference) flow depth, and a flow width that equals the pixel size, $\Delta x$. For each time step, all runoff that is generated ($R_s$) is added as side-flow ($q_{sr}$). For each flowpath, the routing stops at the first downstream pixel that is part of the channel network. In other words, the routine only routes the surface runoff *to* the nearest channel; no runoff *through* the channel network is simulated at this stage (runoff- and channel routing are completely separated). 




## Routing of sub-surface runoff to channel

All water that flows out of the upper- and lower groundwater zone is routed to the nearest downstream channel pixel within one time step.
Recalling once more that the groundwater equations are valid for the pixel's permeable fraction only, the contribution of each pixel to the nearest channel is made up of $(f_{forest}+f_{other)} \cdot (Q_uz + Q_lz)$. Figure 2.12 illustrates the routing procedure: for each pixel that contains a river channel, its contributing pixels are defined by the drainage network. For every 'river pixel' the groundwater outflow that is generated by its upstream pixels is simply summed. For instance, there are two flow paths that are contributing to the second \'river pixel\' from the left in Figure below. Hence, the amount of water that is transported to this pixel equals the sum of the amounts of water produced by these flowpaths, q1 + q2. Note that, as with the surface runoff routing, no water is routed *through* the river network at this stage.

## Channel routing

Flow through the channel is simulated using the kinematic wave equations. The basic equations and the numerical solution are identical to those used for the surface runoff routing:
$$
\frac{\partial Q_{ch}}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial A_{ch}}{\partial t} = q_{ch}
$$
where $Q_{ch}$ is the channel discharge $[\frac{m^3}{s}]$, $A_{ch}$ is the cross-sectional area of the flow $[m^2]$ and $q_ch$ is the amount of lateral inflow per unit flow length $[\frac{m^2}{s}]$. The momentum equation then becomes:
$$
\rho \cdot gA_{ch} \cdot (S_0 - S_f) = 0
$$
where $S_0$ now equals the gradient of the channel bed, and $S_0=S_f$. As with the surface runoff, values for parameter $Œ±_{k,ch}$ are estimated using Manning's equation:
$$
\alpha _{k,ch} = (\frac{n \cdot P_{ch}^{2/3}}{\sqrt{S_0}})^{0.6}; \beta _k=0.6
$$
At present, LISFLOOD uses values for $Œ±_{k,ch}$ which are based on a static (reference) channel flow depth (half bankfull) and measured channel dimensions. The term $q_{ch}$ (sideflow) now represents the runoff that enters the channel per unit channel length:
$$
q_{ch} = \frac{\sum Q_{sr} + \sum Q_{uz} + \sum Q_{lz} + Q_{in} + Q_{res}}{L_{ch}}
$$
Here, $Q_{sr}, Q_{uz}$ and $Q_{lz}$ denote the contributions of surface runoff, outflow from the upper zone and outflow from the lower zone, respectively. $Q_{in}$ is the inflow from an external inflow hydrograph; by default its value is 0, unless the 'inflow hydrograph' option is activated (see Annex 2). $Q_{res}$ is the water that flows out of a reservoir into the channel; by default its value is 0, unless the 'reservoir' option is activated (see **Section XXXXX**). $Q_{sr}, Q_{uz}, Q_{lz}, Q_{in}$ and $Q_{res}$ are all expressed in [$m^3]$ per time step. $L_{ch}$ is the channel length $[m]$, which may exceed the pixel size ($\Delta x$) in case of meandering channels. The kinematic wave channel routing can be run using a smaller time-step than the over simulation timestep, $\Delta t$, if needed.
